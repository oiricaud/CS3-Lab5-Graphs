# CS3-Lab5-Graphs

Description: Graphs are simple, yet powerful, mathametical structures that enable us to describe
relationships between objects, for this reason, graphs have been studied extensively nd many
algorithms have been proposed to solve problems related to them. In fact, many problems can
be reduced to a problem involving graphs.

Problem: Create graph classes using andjacency matrices, adjacency lists, and edge list that implement
the following graph operations:
• Breadth-First-Search
• Depth-First-Search
• Topological Sort
• Kruskal’s Algorithm
• Dijkstra’s Algorithm
• Prim’s Algorithm
• Connected Components
• Strongly Connected Components
• Euler Path or Circuit
• Hamiltonian Path or Cycle
• Extra: Graph Isomorphism

Run experiments with several graphs types (directed, undirected, weighted, unweighted), and write
a report describing your results.
